    <h1>Learning GitHub Pages</h1>
    <p>
        Right then, here we are again. This is continuing on from <a href="githubadd.html">the githubadd.html file that I'm working in.</a>
        Decided I should create a new file for learning GitHub Pages. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm learning from <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site" target="blank">the github pages docs.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Okay, so it says that "if your site is an independent project, you can create a new repository to store your site's source code".
        I should probably put this in there to be honest. I'll create the new repo and then move this file into that. 
        I have read ahead and it says to create an index.md file (i think it's index.md) which tells the browser which pages to include.
    </p>
    <section>
        Okay, so next it talks about the "publishing source". What's that then? <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites" target="blank">Have a look at the docs for info on publishing sources</a>
        <h2>publishing source</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                "The publishing source for you GitHub Pages site is the branch and folder where the source files for your site are stored"
                Right so basically the publishing source is going to be the root so I don't need to create a /doc? I think?
            </p> 
            <h2>index.md</h2>
            <p>OKay, so this is the index.md thing I was talking about.
                It says "In the root of the publishing source, create a new file called <em>index.md</em> that contains the content you want to display on the main page of your site"
                Not really sure so let's read on. when it says contains the content, what exactly does it mean? A list of the content or the actual content?
                It says - "tip: If index.html is present, this will be used instead of index.md. If neither index.html nor index.md are 
                present , README.md will be used"
                Oh no, now it says "configure you publishing source." There's more info on that here
            </p>
            <p>Right then, I've made a new repo for GH Pages. I've actually got it up online. 
                I realise now what the index.html thing is. Well, I have a better idea of it anyway. 
                I'm going to try actually adding in the section 10 html to the index to see what happens.
                Wish me luck.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right, well I put the html code for section 10 into the index.md file but for some reason it isn't showing up 
                on the webpage. It's jsut showing the initial stuff I put on there. Bahhhh.
            </p>
