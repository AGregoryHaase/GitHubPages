    <h1>Learning GitHub Pages</h1>
    <p>
        Right then, here we are again. This is continuing on from <a href="githubadd.html">the githubadd.html file that I'm working in.</a>
        Decided I should create a new file for learning GitHub Pages. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm learning from <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site" target="blank">the github pages docs.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Okay, so it says that "if your site is an independent project, you can create a new repository to store your site's source code".
        I should probably put this in there to be honest. I'll create the new repo and then move this file into that. 
        I have read ahead and it says to create an index.md file (i think it's index.md) which tells the browser which pages to include.
    </p>
    <section>
        Okay, so next it talks about the "publishing source". What's that then? <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites" target="blank">Have a look at the docs for info on publishing sources</a>
        <h2>publishing source</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                "The publishing source for you GitHub Pages site is the branch and folder where the source files for your site are stored"
                Right so basically the publishing source is going to be the root so I don't need to create a /doc? I think?
            </p> 
            <h2>index.md</h2>
            <p>OKay, so this is the index.md thing I was talking about.
                It says "In the root of the publishing source, create a new file called <em>index.md</em> that contains the content you want to display on the main page of your site"
                Not really sure so let's read on. when it says contains the content, what exactly does it mean? A list of the content or the actual content?
                It says - "tip: If index.html is present, this will be used instead of index.md. If neither index.html nor index.md are 
                present , README.md will be used"
                Oh no, now it says "configure you publishing source." There's more info on that here
            </p>
            <p>Right then, I've made a new repo for GH Pages. I've actually got it up online. 
                I realise now what the index.html thing is. Well, I have a better idea of it anyway. 
                I'm going to try actually adding in the section 10 html to the index to see what happens.
                Wish me luck.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right, well I put the html code for section 10 into the index.md file but for some reason it isn't showing up 
                on the webpage. It's jsut showing the initial stuff I put on there. Bahhhh.
            </p>
            <p>OKay, maybe I just need to wait a couple of minutes. It seems to have worked. I came back and cloned the repo and moved this file to it, then pushed it to GH. 
                When I reloaded the page it was working. 
            </p>
            <p>My question now is, how do I add in more pages???</p>
            <p>I want to add in section 9. I actually meant to do section 9 to start with. Maybe it is only a page. I'm going to do another repo and just get section 9 on because I really really want to see it online.
                Oh yeah, what's cool is that it has used the CSS too. OKay, let me repeat with section 9.
            </p>
            <p>Wow, okay, I managed to get section 9 up. A couple of things are not working but I'll have to come back to it later and see if I can make a difference. 
                But that's really cool. I have it online. Just want to find out if it's possible to have more than one page so that I can have
                all the sections together on one repo?
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, it's 10:10, I'd better go and get ready. Very productive hour.

                Riiiight. 
                Had Claude over the weekend and didn't really get anything done with this. It's Monday at 2pm. 
                Gonna just jump straight into this video that has tips and tricks for Git.
            </p>
            <h2>Git tips and tricks </h2>
            <p>Okay, this video has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecK3EnyGD8o">"13 (advanced) but useful Git Techniques and shortcuts"</a> 
                Video starts off by saying that Git was invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> , also the inventor of the Linux Kernal, in 2005.
                Have a proper read of his wiki at some point please! Just had a quick read of the 1st couple of paragraphs. It mentions machine code, Basic, and assembly language. 
                Read up on these and other links that come up.
                <ol>
                    <li><p>
                        The -am flag - Instead of using, git add, git commit, we can use git commit -am "just like that"
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>git config > Provides a way to create alias.
                            <ul>
                                <li>git config --global alias.ac "commit -am"</li>
                                <li>FInd the Docs for more on creating alias</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>   
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Right, most of this stuff is way more advanced than I can use. 
                There's Bisect, Squash from Rebase, hooks, destruction, fetch, reset, clean, checkout -. 
            </p>
            <p>I think that's it. 
                Right, it's 2:50. That was a nice little vid to watch. Bit of history with Linus Torvalds.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll come back to it. Will probably cover some if this in the Colt Course I've started. 
            </p>
